 Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

 There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

 Example 1:
 Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
 Output: 2

 Example 2:
 Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
 Output: 3

 Example 3:
 Input: nums = [1,1]
 Output: 1

 Example 4:
 Input: nums = [1,1,2]
 Output: 1

     Why Using Cycle Detection

     According to the description of this problem, we knowing that the value of the elements might between 1 to count.

     So the hint tells as we might be ok to see this array as a kind of flow. Base on this,
     we also can say the value of an elements is represent the next index we can go.

     For example, if we have a given array [1, 3, 4, 2, 3]

     +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
     | [0] | [1] | [2] | [3] | [4] |
     +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
     |  1  |  3  |  4  |  2  |  3  |
     +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
     We started from [0], we found that we start from 1, then we got 3 at [1], 2 at [3] and so on.

     And let's trying to redraw this array into a simple flow. (I am not sure we can call it a state machine or not lol)

     +---+    +---+    +---+    +---+
     | 1 | -> | 3 | -> | 2 | -> | 4 |
     +---+    +---+    +---+    +---+
                ^                 |
                |                 |
                +-----------------+

     Then we got a flow has a cycle. And that's the reason why we can use Floyd to solve this problem.
