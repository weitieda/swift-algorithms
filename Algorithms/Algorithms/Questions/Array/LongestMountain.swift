 You may recall that an array arr is a mountain array if and only if:

 arr.length >= 3

 There exists some index i (0-indexed) with 0 < i < arr.length - 1 such that:
 - arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]
 - arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]

 Given an integer array arr, return the length of the longest subarray, which is a mountain. Return 0 if there is no mountain subarray.

 e.g.
 Input: arr = [2,1,4,7,3,2,5]
 Output: 5
 Explanation: The largest mountain is [1,4,7,3,2] which has length 5.

 e.g.
 Input: arr = [2,2,2]
 Output: 0
 Explanation: There is no mountain.
